0.002005  renamed jQuery.DSt.js to jquery.dst.js in order to fit convention.

0.002004  moved source code to src/DSt.js; this source file is used to generate
          minified DSt.js and minified jQuery plugin jQuery.DSt.js.  added 
          Makefile for this, which uses the Yahoo YUI Compressor (not
          included).  added test/ directory, containing simple test HTML.
          changed store and recall to bail when presented with nonexistent
          or nameless elements.

0.002003  now works in IE 8; JSON storage (re-)added

0.002002  now handles radio buttons, checkboxes, text inputs, textareas;
          storage now takes place directly in localStorage (not in lS.DSt)

0.002001  new interface: get/set, store/recall, store_form/recall_form

0.001003  reworked storage_types(); changed initializer in _gethash()

0.001002  detabbed to 2spc; wrapped DSt definition in anonymous function to
          allow changing global namespace

0.001001  first commit!  set, get, store, recall, populate, storage_types
